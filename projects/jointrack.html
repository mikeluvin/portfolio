                    <h2>TL;DR</h2>
                    <p>If you don't have the time to read my blog-post-esque project description below, here's a quick overview.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Wanted to improve integration of new members into NU Track Club's communication stream</li>
                        <li>So a teammate and I created a sign up page for NU Track Club to accomplish this</li>
                        <li>Users sign in to their NU Gmail through Google Auth, which adds them to the Listserv (mailing list)</li>
                        <li>Users then sign in to their GroupMe account, adding them to the NUTC GroupMe</li>
                        <li>Finally, users are provided a link to IMLeagues to sign up to become a member of Track Club</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>What did <i>I</i> do, in terms of <b>development?</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Utilized the GroupMe Developers' API to add an authenicated user to the NUTC GroupMe
                            <ul>
                                <li>Verified that the user had an NU email address with the Google API</li>
                                <li>Parsed user information returned by GroupMe API to create the HTTP POST request
                                    to add the user to the GroupMe
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Implemented a SQLite database that stores all the users who have signed up through jointrack.club with their UTC timestamp
                            <ul>
                                <li>Included methods for adminstrative actions, such as adding page abusers to the blocked list</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        </li>
                    
                    </ul>
                    <p>Now...if you'd like to read more, continue below!</p>                        

                    <h2>Background</h2>
                    <!--probably want to put in a pic for each section-->
                    <p>
                        A fellow NUTC Member (well, 2020 grad), John Laboe, wanted to create an all-in-one sign up page for the club.
                        When a new member joins, they provide us their email for our mailing list and their phone number so they can be added
                        to our GroupMe. They must also sign up for the club on IMLeagues in order to attend practice. <br><br>
                        Manually adding everyone to our mailing list and GroupMe is a bit of a hassle--why not have a sign up page to 
                        streamline the process?                      

                    </p>
                    <h2>Development</h2>
                    <p>
                        Join Track was my first web development project ever. I had just decided to switch my focus to Software Engineering the
                        month before (in June 2020), after realizing how much I enjoyed programming. Was I behind my peers since I didn't take a CS
                        class until my sophomore year? Yes, but I knew I could make up the gap because of how passionate I am about CS. To complete Join Track,
                        I knew that I would have to learn a lot on my own (with some guidance from John, of course), and I was excited for the challenge. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>An API...what's that?</h3>
                    <p>
                        My first task was to use the GroupMe Developers' API to add a user to the NUTC GroupMe. John told me that I needed to set up a 
                        Python Flask server to do so. He sent me links the GM API and Flask documentation, and then I was on my own. 
                        <ul>
                            <li>React</li>
                            <li>Flask server</li>
                            <li>SQLite database</li>
                            <li>admin frontend + backend</li>
                        </ul>
                        I wanted to add a feature to automatically add a user to our Strava club, but unfortunately the Strava
                        Developers API does not have an endpoint to do so.
