                    <h2>TL;DR</h2>
                    <p>If you don't have the time to read my blog post project description below, here's a quick overview.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We wanted to improve integration of new members into NU Track Club's communication stream</li>
                        <li>New members need to be added to our Listserv (mailing list) and GroupMe: adding 50+ people is a bit of a hassle</li>
                        <li>So a teammate and I created a sign up page for NU Track Club to ease this process</li>
                        <li>Users sign in to their NU Gmail through Google Auth, which adds them to the Listserv</li>
                        <li>Users then sign in to their GroupMe account, adding them to the NUTC GroupMe</li>
                        <li>Finally, users are provided a link to IMLeagues to sign up to become a member of Track Club</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>What did <i>I</i> do, in terms of <b>development?</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Utilized the GroupMe Developers' API to add an authenicated user to the NUTC GroupMe
                            <ul>
                                <li>Verified that the user had an NU email address with the Google API</li>
                                <li>Parsed user information returned by GroupMe API to create the HTTP POST request
                                    to add the user to the GroupMe
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Implemented a SQLite database that stores all the users who have signed up through jointrack.club with their UTC timestamp
                            <ul>
                                <li>Included methods for adminstrative actions, such as adding page abusers to the blocked list</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Set up the admin page: admin identity verified through the Google API with every call to our server
                            <ul>
                                <li>Verify that the user is, in fact, an admin on our Python Flask server every time the user
                                    attempts an admin action
                                </li>
                                <li>Admins can view and add admins</li>
                                <li>Admins can view all page users, view blocked users, and add/remove blocked users</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        We got the page up and running in time for the Fall 2020 Student Organization Fair, where ~45 new members 
                        used the page!
                    </p>
                    <p>Now...if you'd like to read more about how the development process went, continue below!</p>                        

                    <h2>Background</h2>
                    <!--probably want to put in a pic for each section-->
                    <p>
                        A fellow NUTC Member (well, 2020 grad), John Laboe, wanted to create an all-in-one sign up page for the club.
                        When a new member joins the club, they provide us their email for our mailing list and their phone number so they can be added
                        to our GroupMe. They must also sign up for the club on IMLeagues in order to attend practice. <br><br>
                        Manually adding everyone to our mailing list and GroupMe is a bit of a hassle--why not have a sign up page to 
                        streamline the process?                      

                    </p>
                    <h2>Development</h2>
                    <p>
                        Join Track was my first web development project ever. I had just decided to switch my focus to Software Engineering the
                        month before (in June 2020), after realizing how much I enjoyed programming. Was I behind my peers since I didn't take a CS
                        class until my sophomore year? Yes, but I knew I could make up the gap because of how passionate I am about CS. To complete Join Track,
                        I knew that I would have to learn a lot on my own (with some guidance from John, of course), and I was excited for the challenge. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>An API...what's that?</h3>
                    <p>
                        My first task was to use the GroupMe Developers' API to add a user to the NUTC GroupMe. John told me that I needed to set up a 
                        Python Flask server to do so. He sent me links to the GM API and Flask documentation, and then I was on my own. There were so many things
                        I was confused about...what the heck is an API? (So that's how those Trump Twitter bots are made...) An HTTP Request? (the WWW runs on em!)
                        Why do we need to add a user on our own server instead of doing it on the front-end? (Why would we want everyone to see our GM access tokens?)
                        If nothing else (there was *plenty* of "else"), this project significantly improved my Google search skills.
                    </p>

                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Eventually, after reading lots of articles on Google, I figured out how to set up a Flask App in Python and create an endpoint where I would
                        add a user to the GroupMe. In the endpoint, I sent an HTTP request to the GM API to get the signed in user's information, then extracted their 
                        name and username from the response object. I created a JSON object with the required information to add the user to the group, as specified in  
                        the GM Developers' documentation. Finally, I sent that JSON object in a HTTP POST request to the GM API endpoint used to add a user to the group.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        John created a test GroupMe group, to which I was supposed to get added. However, I could not seem to get it to work, despite my debugging
                        efforts. It turns out that I had formatted the URL of the HTTP POST request incorrectly (oops, happens when you're new to this): I put the 
                        group ID in the wrong place. Once that was fixed, I got added to our test group. My first task was complete!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I committed and pushed my changes with Git, and made my first pull request. I got used to that pretty quickly.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Unfamiliar Technologies: the S(e)Q(ue)L</h3>
                    <p>
                        After John reviewed my pull request and made a few improvements, he tasked me with creating an interface for a SQLite database in Python. Another
                        new technology to learn? Yep! This database would store a list of: page admins, all users who signed up through the page, and blocked users. The 
                        Python interface, implemented as a Class, provided methods to add/remove/view/verify admins, add/remove/view page abusers to/from/on the block 
                        list, verify if someone is on the block list, and add/view all page users.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Implementing the database interface was fairly straightforward. The SQLite3 Python library was pretty easy to pick up; I had no issues implementing 
                        the database methods. I whipped up some tests to verify that the methods worked as intended, and lo and behold, they did.
                    </p>
                    <h3>What could have been...</h3>
                    <p>
                        NUTC has increased our use of Strava over the past year or so. I love the platform--I think it's a great way to keep in touch with 
                        my runner friends. I wanted to add a feature to automatically add a user to our Strava club, but unfortunately the Strava
                        Developers API does not have an endpoint to do so. Hopefully they will include this feature in the next version of
                        their API!
                    </p>
                    <h2>Results</h2>
                    <p>
                        The page seemed ready to go for the Fall 2020 Student Organization Fair. We hosted our "table" on Zoom, so jointrack.club
                        made it extremely easy for students to sign up: all we had to do was drop the link in the chat. Since our site uses cookies,
                        we had to tell students to not use private browsing when signing up.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Despite our testing, there were still issues adding some users to the GroupMe. Out of the ~45 students who were successfully
                        added to the Listserv, about 10 or so did not make it into the GroupMe. We will have to look at the logs to see what went wrong.
